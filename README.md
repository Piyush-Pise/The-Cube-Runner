# The-Cube-Runner

Cube Runner is an Android game developed using Unity. The game's objective is for the player to reach the end of each level by dodging obstacles in their path. Colliding with an obstacle results in the player losing health points (HP). The game also includes a third-person shooter mechanism, which enables the player to shoot down obstacles, save HP, and clear the path. The game is won by the player who successfully reaches the end of each level without dying. Currently, the game only has one level, but more levels are planned to be added in the future

### How to Play
The joystick on the left side of the screen controls the movement of the cube or ball. On the right side of the screen, there are two buttons: one for aiming and the other for firing. You can adjust the joystick sensitivity by accessing the options tab within the options menu.

### Getting Started
To play the game on your Android device, you need to download and install the ‘Cube Runner 1_3.apk’ file.
